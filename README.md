## Getting Started

This project is divided into 2 parts.  
First, we will explain about the first part and then about the second part.

The project is about JAVA Threading, Callable && Future interfaces,  
Creating/Reading/Deleting files and Priority Based Task Scandalising.

## About Threading in JAVA
A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed.
Generally, all the programs have at least one thread,
known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or
Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the programâ€™s execution.  
At this point,
the main() method is invoked by the main thread.

A thread is an execution thread in a program.  
Multiple threads of execution can be run concurrently
by an application running on the Java Virtual Machine. 
The priority of each thread varies.  
Higher priority threads are executed before lower priority threads.

Thread is critical in the program because it enables multiple
operations to take place within a single method.
Each thread in the program often has its own program
counter, stack, and local variable.

# Ex2 - Part 1
## [Ex2_1](https://github.com/aradbm/OOP_Ex2/blob/master/src/Ex2_1/Ex2_1.java)


This class helps you creates and delete files while also helps you track
of the total number of lines in the files you created using multiple method
where each uses different way: thread-pool, threads or without  
threads at all.

#### `String[] createTextFiles(int n, int seed, int bound)`:
Method that creates "n" text files with number of rows based on
"seed" and "bound" parameters,  
where each row says "hello world!". The method names each file "file_i.txt" where i is the number of file.  
Lastly, the method stores all the files×³ names in a String array and returns it.

#### `int getNumOfLines(String[] fileNames)`:
Method that receives a String array containing files×³ names,  
and counts and returns the total number of rows in them.

#### `int getNumOfLinesThreads(String[] fileNames)`:
Method that receives a String array containing files×³ names,  
and counts and returns the total number of rows in them using threads.  
For each file, a new thread is created that counts the number of rows in it.  
Thus, we sum all the values the threads counted, meaning total rows number, and return it.

#### `int getNumOfLinesThreadPool(String[] fileNames)`:
Method that receives a String array containing files×³ names,  
and counts and returns the total number of rows in them using thread-pool.  
We first create a thread-pool called "threadPool" (ExecutorService object)
which can contain at most "MAX_THREADS" threads (Defined to be number of files).  
For each file, a new thread is created (to count it×³s rows)
and added to the threadPool using submit().  
Also, a Future object is created to hold the future result we get.  
All of those result are summed up and returned (this is the total number of rows).

#### `void deleteFiles(String[] fileNames)`:
Method that deletes all the files in "fileNames" array.  
This method helps clean after each test and avoid flooding the system.  
If we fail to delete a specific file, we print there was an error.

## Tests
### Part 1
![App Screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/GFhPNH8/Screenshot-2022-12-31-at-13-30-37.png)
The times for each method we used to calculate:  
__Without Threads:__
![App Screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/KwJmjjY/Screenshot-2022-12-31-at-13-31-14.png)
__With Threads:__

__With Thread Pool:__

What we did here is test each method with the same number of rows.  
Thus, we got a fair comparison between the time it took each method.  
Each method was tested with a large number of files (100) so that we can see a noticable  
difference between them.

Though we probably expected the thread method to be faster then without threads at all,  
and thread pool to be faster than both, we got completely different results.
