## Getting Started

This project is divided into 2 parts.  
First, we will explain about the first part and then about the second part.

The project is about JAVA Threading, Callable && Future interfaces,  
Creating/Reading/Deleting files and Priority Based Task Scandalising.

What is a Thread in Java?

A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the programâ€™s execution. At this point, when the main thread is provided, the main() method is invoked by the main thread.

A thread is an execution thread in a program. Multiple threads of execution can be run concurrently by an application running on the Java Virtual Machine. The priority of each thread varies. Higher priority threads are executed before lower priority threads.

Thread is critical in the program because it enables multiple operations to take place within a single method. Each thread in the program often has its own program counter, stack, and local variable.
